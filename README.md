This AI tool is designed to assist students with their homework assignments. Students can simply upload their completed .c files, and the tool will provide a comprehensive description in compliance with school requirements. The algorithm visually presents the assignment task, the student's code, and the expected output generated by AI. Additionally, it generates a detailed description of the code in Polish.

For visual clarity, the tool automatically adjusts the size and layout of the code to ensure appropriate aspect ratios for picture versions, and it can split code across multiple pages as needed. Final version is provided into the PDF file.
